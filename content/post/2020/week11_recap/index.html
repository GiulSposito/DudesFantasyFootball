<h3>Paulinia Robots Waxes Brotas Alligators, Fans Flames of Failure</h3>
<p>Paulinia Robots crushed Brotas Alligators 152.64 to 89.26 while putting up the third-highest score this season.

<h3>Sorocaba Wild Mules Blasts Indaiatuba Blues</h3>
<p>Sorocaba Wild Mules crushed Indaiatuba Blues 129.28 to 84.56 behind Keenan Allen (145 Rec Yds, 1 TD), whose 34.50 points were the highest player score of the week. Sorocaba Wild Mules took a 37.58-point lead on Thursday and maintained an advantage throughout the matchup. With the win, Sorocaba Wild Mules clinches a spot in the playoffs. This win had a taste of revenge for Sorocaba Wild Mules following a difficult postseason defeat last year to Indaiatuba Blues. Sorocaba Wild Mules (8-3, 1,225.52 points) remains in first place and Indaiatuba Blues (5-6, 1,174.46 points) stays in seventh place.</p>
<p>There was a player on both teams that had plenty of chances but missed out on opportunities. On the winning side, Ronald Jones got 10 touches but only tallied 24 total yards, while Duke Johnson managed just 35 yards on 13 touches for Indaiatuba Blues.</p>
<p>While Ronald Jones led Sorocaba Wild Mules matches (with 24.80 points), Allen has now been the team’s high scorer in two of the last three weeks. Also, with 12 targets this week for Michael Thomas, it means that his targets have now increased in three consecutive games.</p>
<p>In Week 12, Sorocaba Wild Mules plays Campinas Giants (7-4, 1,277.50), while Indaiatuba Blues matches up against Amparo Bikers (5-6, 1,278.56).</p>

<h3>Limeira Guara Wolf Beats Indaiatuba Riders for 7th Consecutive Win</h3>
<p>Limeira Guara Wolf (8-3, 1,257.28 points) defeated Indaiatuba Riders (2-9, 1,153.76 points) 125.68 to 106.16 led by Travis Kelce (127 Rec Yds, 1 TD) with 26.86 points and D.J. Moore (127 Rec Yds), who scored 21.80. Limeira Guara Wolf came into the Sunday games already in front 36.60 to 9.00.

However, following the late Sunday games, Limeira Guara Wolf regained the lead for good with the help of 21.42 points from Philip Rivers. With the win, Limeira Guara Wolf assures themselves a spot in the playoffs.</p>
<p>Chase Edmonds probably deserved more touches for Limeira Guara Wolf, as he put up a whopping 49 total yards on just six touches.</p>

<h3>Amparo Bikers Pounds London Knights to Move into 8th Place</h3>
<p>Amparo Bikers pummeled London Knights 143.62 to 95.50 while putting up the second-highest score this week. This beating was revenge for a loss to London Knights in their last meeting a season ago. Diontae Johnson (acquired via trade in Week 6) and Chase Claypool (acquired via free agency in Week 6) made a big impact, posting 23.10 and 15.90 points, respectively. The gap could have been wider as Amparo Bikers had a starter score zero points (Hayden Hurst). Amparo Bikers (5-6, 1,278.56 points) climbs into eighth place and London Knights (4-7, 1,182.26 points) stays in 11th place.</p>
<p>Kalen Ballage had plenty of chances for Amparo Bikers, but he logged just 71 total yards on 23 touches.</p>
<p>In addition to the fantasy W, Amparo Bikers was savvy enough to pick winners in real-life football, as well. Among all of their starters, the Atlanta TE was the only one that didn’t play on a winning NFL team in Week 11. While Diontae Johnson led Amparo Bikers with 23.60 points last week, Woods paced the squad this week with 30.60.</p>
<p>Next week, Amparo Bikers gets Indaiatuba Blues (5-6, 1,174.46), while London Knights faces Rio Claro Farmers (8-3, 1,250.02).</p>

<h3>Rio Claro Farmers Handles Sorocaba Steelers, Tacks On 5th Consecutive Win</h3>
<p>Rio Claro Farmers took advantage of 25.50 points from Cooper Kupp (145 Rec Yds) and 21.74 from Aaron Rodgers (311 Pas Yds, 3 TD/1 Int) to crush Sorocaba Steelers 140.84 to 98.28. Rio Claro Farmers took a 9.72-point lead on Sunday afternoon and never looked back. With the win, Rio Claro Farmers secures a playoff spot. This beating was revenge for a loss to Sorocaba Steelers in their last meeting a season ago.

Rio Claro Farmers (8-3, 1,250.02 points) climbs into third place and Sorocaba Steelers (5-6, 1,213.94 points) drops to ninth place.</p>

<h3>Goncalves Miners Brings Down Barao Butchers, Deepens Losing Streak Frustration</h3>
<p>Goncalves Miners had an excellent primetime performance with 48.80 points on Sunday Night Football (38% of their total score) to get the victory over Barao Butchers 129.94 to 95.84. The late heroics were a little unexpected, since they were originally projected to score 31.33 points on Sunday night. Goncalves Miners was led by Adam Thielen (123 Rec Yds, 2 TD). The Minnesota WR scored two touchdowns and contributed 32.30 points to the total. With the New England Patriots DEF delivering zero points for Goncalves Miners, the result might have been even worse.

<p>Goncalves Miners was on another level with their wideouts, as they started two of the league’s top-10 overall WRs this week (including Thielen, who was second-best overall). While D’Andre Swift led Goncalves Miners in Week 10 with 25.90 points, Thielen paved the way this week with 32.30.</p>
<p>In Week 12, Goncalves Miners will meet the last-place team in the league, Indaiatuba Riders (2-9, 1,153.76). Barao Butchers gets Brotas Alligators (3-8, 1,135.70).</p>
