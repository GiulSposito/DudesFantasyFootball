<div id="campinas-giants-comes-from-behind-to-squeak-by-indaiatuba-riders" class="section level3">
<h3>Campinas Giants Comes from Behind to Squeak By Indaiatuba Riders</h3>
<p>Campinas Giants got 18.80 points from Rob Gronkowski (78 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and 16.32 from Nick Foles (198 Pas Yds, 1 Pas TD/1 Int, 1 Rsh TD) to nip Indaiatuba Riders 108.62 to 106.42.

Campinas Giants (4-2, 725.46 points) remains in first place and Indaiatuba Riders (1-5, 689.18 points) is still looking up at everyone from last place.</p>
<p>There was one fairly noteworthy starter on Campinas Giants who wasnâ€™t fully in tune with his QB. Even though DeAndre Hopkins saw a total of eight targets, he only reeled in two catches.</p>
<p>In addition to the fantasy W, Campinas Giants was keen enough to select winners in real football, as well. Every one of their starters played on a winning NFL team this past week. Since Gronkowski was the top point-getter for Campinas Giants, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 44.70 points, Alvin Kamara paced the squad in Week 3, while Jerick McKinnon (22.70 points) was tops in Week 4 and DeAndre Hopkins (25.10 points) last week.</p>
<p>Campinas Giants plays Sorocaba Steelers (3-3, 653.22) next week, while Indaiatuba Riders matches up against Limeira Dead Rabbits (3-3, 671.34).</p>

This is the third-most a team has scored this season without getting the victory. The loss drops Goncalves Miners to 3-3 (5th place) and breaks their two-game winning streak.

<h3>Indaiatuba Blues Steals Win from Sorocaba Steelers, Claims 3rd Place</h3>
<p>Indaiatuba Blues was clutch when the lights came on with 49.30 points on Monday Night Football (41% of their total score) to steal the win from Sorocaba Steelers 121.36 to 116.48.

Kenyan Drake also chipped in 28.40 points by getting 164 rushing yards (164 Rsh Yds, 2 TD). The outcome could have been worse as Indaiatuba Blues had a starter score zero points (Mike Gesicki). Indaiatuba Blues (4-2, 739.40 points) climbs into third place, while Sorocaba Steelers (3-3, 653.22 points) steps into seventh place.</p>
<p>Miles Sanders ultimately deserved more touches for Indaiatuba Blues, as he put up a whopping 118 total yards on just 10 touches.</p>
<p>Indaiatuba Blues lucked out that Josh Jacobs (18.30 points per game) had a bye this week, since top-scoring RB for Sorocaba Steelers (Mike Davis) only managed 11.50 points.
