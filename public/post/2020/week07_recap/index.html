<h2>League Highlights</h2>
<p>Limeira Guara Wolf won this week, even without starting a top-15 scoring QB.</p>
<p>Barao Butchers has now beaten their weekly score projection in each matchup this season.</p>
<p>Brotas Alligators has now beaten their weekly score projection in each matchup this season.</p>
<p>Sorocaba Wild Mules continues defying the pundits, and has beaten their projected score three weeks in a row.</p>
<p>London Knights has now increased their score each of the past three weeks.</p>
<p>No surprise here: teams have won 66.7% of the time this season when starting the league’s top-scoring QB of the week (4-2 overall).</p>
<p>Paulinia Robots probably wishes they had started Justin Herbert. The 38.48 points he scored would have represented the third-highest individual score this week.</p>
<p>Limeira Guara Wolf is on a three-game winning streak.</p>
<p>Campinas Giants is on a three-game winning streak.</p>
<p>Teams have won a mere 30.0% of the time this season (3-7) when they fail to throw a Pass TD.</p>
<p>Campinas Giants was projected to win by the widest margin in the league this week (18.88 points) and they topped it with a 19.46-point victory.</p>

<div id="limeira-guara-wolf-rallies-against-paulinia-robots-streak-now-at-three" class="section level3">
<h3>Limeira Guara Wolf Rallies Against Paulinia Robots, Streak Now at Three</h3>
<p>Limeira Guara Wolf was clutch under the lights with 53.00 points on Sunday Night Football (36% of their total score) to steal the win from Paulinia Robots 148.48 to 109.44. The late heroics were especially impressive, as they were originally projected to tally just 22.66 points on Sunday night. Limeira Guara Wolf was led by Tyler Lockett this week (200 Rec Yds, 3 TD). Lockett racked up 200 yards and provided 53.00 points to the final tally. D.J. Moore also helped out with 25.30 points by getting two touchdowns (93 Rec Yds, 2 TD). With the Seattle Seahawks DEF delivering zero points for Limeira Guara Wolf, the outcome could have been worse. The 148.48 points represented the fourth-best total in the league this season, as well. Limeira Guara Wolf (4-3, 787.78 points) climbs into fifth place, while Paulinia Robots (3-4, 838.10 points) stays in ninth place.</p>
<p>While Travis Kelce led Limeira Guara Wolf last week with 21.50 points, Lockett paved the way this week with 53.00.</p>
<p>Next week, Limeira Guara Wolf faces Goncalves Miners (3-4, 874.02), who puts up a league-leading 124.86 points per game. Paulinia Robots takes on Indaiatuba Blues (4-3, 826.68).</p>
</div>
<div id="sorocaba-wild-mules-rallies-to-beat-barao-butchers-grabs-2nd-place" class="section level3">
<h3>Sorocaba Wild Mules Rallies to Beat Barao Butchers, Grabs 2nd Place</h3>
<p>Sorocaba Wild Mules (5-2, 761.48 points) beat Barao Butchers (4-3, 858.84 points) 112.08 to 103.96. They were led by Russell Wilson with 29.92 points off of 388 passing yards and Keenan Allen (125 Rec Yds), who had 22.50. Sorocaba Wild Mules was first to put points on the board and went into Sunday with a 9.00 to 0.00 lead. They gave up that lead after the late Sunday games and were behind 89.86 to 82.16. Tom Brady provided a jolt for Barao Butchers during those games, with 36.86 points. The Seahawks/Cardinals game on Sunday night came to an end with Sorocaba Wild Mules up by 17.12 and they stayed on top through the rest of the matchup.</p>
<p>Chris Carson probably deserved more touches for Barao Butchers, as he put up a whopping 41 total yards on just six touches.</p>
<p>While Justin Jefferson led Sorocaba Wild Mules weeks (with 39.60 points), Wilson has now been the team’s leading scorer in four of the last five matches.</p>
<p>In Week 8, Sorocaba Wild Mules goes up against Indaiatuba Riders (2-5, 799.54), the last-place team in the league. Barao Butchers takes on Amparo Bikers (2-5, 820.66).</p>
</div>
<div id="indaiatuba-riders-gets-late-win-over-limeira-dead-rabbits" class="section level3">
<h3>Indaiatuba Riders Gets Late Win over Limeira Dead Rabbits</h3>
<p>Indaiatuba Riders picked up 24.16 points from Deshaun Watson (309 Pas Yds, 38 Rsh Yds, 2 TD) and 19.20 from Kareem Hunt (76 Rsh Yds, 26 Rec Yds, 1 Rec TD) to beat Limeira Dead Rabbits 110.36 to 104.62. Indaiatuba Riders came into the Monday night game facing a 6.16-point deficit, but scored 11.90 for the comeback victory. This matchup included four lead changes, with the largest lead being 6.16 points after Sunday night. While each team fell short of expectations, Indaiatuba Riders scored 88.8% of their projected 124.25 points to get the win. Indaiatuba Riders started one player with zero points while Limeira Dead Rabbits also served up one goose egg, meaning both teams left points off the scoreboard. Limeira Dead Rabbits (3-4, 775.96 points) steps into 10th place and Indaiatuba Riders (2-5, 799.54 points) remains mired in the cellar.</p>
<p>Sadly for Limeira Dead Rabbits, Cam Newton was the lone quarterback to tally a negative score (one of only two total starters in the league to do so ). Rex Burkhead really deserved more touches for Limeira Dead Rabbits, as he put up an efficient 47 all-purpose yards on just seven total touches.</p>
<p>While Derrick Henry led Indaiatuba Riders matches (with 40.40 points), Watson has now been the team’s leading scorer in two of the past three weeks. Also, with 25 touches this week for Todd Gurley, it means that his touches have now increased in four consecutive games.</p>
<p>Next week, Indaiatuba Riders gets Sorocaba Wild Mules (5-2, 761.48), while Limeira Dead Rabbits battles Sorocaba Steelers (3-4, 750.44).</p>
</div>
<div id="brotas-alligators-rips-apart-amparo-bikers-grabs-12th-place" class="section level3">
<h3>Brotas Alligators Rips Apart Amparo Bikers, Grabs 12th Place</h3>
<p>Brotas Alligators got the second-highest point total in the league this week, dismantling Amparo Bikers 147.70 to 87.80. Brotas Alligators took a 22.00-point lead on Sunday afternoon and maintained that advantage for the rest of the matchup. This was a story for the grandchildren, with the 59.90-point margin being the highest recorded in the league this season. Brotas Alligators (3-4, 802.14 points) climbs into 12th place and Amparo Bikers (2-5, 820.66 points) drops to 13th place.</p>
<p>There was one starter on Brotas Alligators that missed out on some chances. Even though Noah Fant saw a total of seven targets, he reeled in just three catches.</p>
<p>It wasn’t all bad news for Amparo Bikers, as they did put together a team of real-life winners. Every starter except Ezekiel Elliott suited up for a winning NFL team in Week 7. Murray has now led Brotas Alligators in scoring in three straight weeks, and for three of the last five.</p>
<p>In Week 8, Brotas Alligators goes up against Rio Claro Farmers (4-3, 758.54). Amparo Bikers gets Barao Butchers (4-3, 858.84), who has averaged an impressive 122.69 points this season.</p>

<div id="campinas-giants-rallies-against-sorocaba-steelers-tacks-on-3rd-consecutive-win" class="section level3">
<h3>Campinas Giants Rallies Against Sorocaba Steelers, Tacks On 3rd Consecutive Win</h3>
<p>Down 17.84 on Sunday night, Campinas Giants came back, taking down Sorocaba Steelers 116.68 to 97.22. Campinas Giants got 24.30 points from DeAndre Hopkins (103 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and 23.68 from Drew Brees (287 Pas Yds, 2 Pas TD, 1 Rsh TD). Campinas Giants was clutch when the lights came on with 37.30 points on Sunday Night Football (32% of their final score). This win was a nice piece of revenge for Campinas Giants following a difficult postseason defeat last year to Sorocaba Steelers. Sorocaba Steelers (3-4, 750.44 points) drops to 11th place and Campinas Giants (5-2, 842.14 points) remains in first place.</p>
<p>On Campinas Giants, Jerick McKinnon represented one of two total starters in the league to tally a negative score (and the only RB to do so ). Mike Davis and Josh Jacobs had several looks for Sorocaba Steelers, but they logged just 67 total yards on 25 combined touches between them.</p>
<p>In addition to the fantasy W, Campinas Giants was savvy enough to choose winners in real life, as well. Among all of their starters, Darius Slayton was the only one that played on a losing NFL team this past week. While Rob Gronkowski led Campinas Giants weeks (with 18.80 points), Hopkins has now been the team’s high scorer in two of the last three matches.</p>
<p>Campinas Giants plays London Knights (4-3, 848.40) next week, while Sorocaba Steelers goes up against Limeira Dead Rabbits (3-4, 775.96).</p>

<div id="rio-claro-farmers-comes-back-to-beat-goncalves-miners-drops-them-into-8th-place" class="section level3">
<h3>Rio Claro Farmers Comes Back to Beat Goncalves Miners, Drops Them into 8th Place</h3>
<p>Rio Claro Farmers got 27.32 points from Aaron Rodgers (283 Pas Yds, 4 TD) and 20.60 from Giovani Bernard (37 Rsh Yds, 59 Rec Yds, 1 Rec TD), taking down Goncalves Miners 112.92 to 105.02. Rio Claro Farmers came into the Monday night game facing a 4.00-point deficit, but scored 11.90 for the comeback victory. This matchup saw three lead changes, with the largest lead being 34.50 points after Sunday afternoon. Rio Claro Farmers met their projections and put up 2.7% more points than projected (109.94). Goncalves Miners scored 91.8% of a projected 114.43 points. The Cincinnati RB (acquired via free agency in Week 7) made a big impact, posting 20.60 points. Rio Claro Farmers (4-3, 758.54 points) falls to seventh place and Goncalves Miners (3-4, 874.02 points) drops to eighth place.</p>
<p>Peterson had plenty of opportunities for Goncalves Miners, but could only manage 30 total yards on 12 touches.</p>
<p>While Justin Herbert led Rio Claro Farmers in Week 5 (with 27.36 points) and Aaron Jones in Week 6 (13.10 points), Rodgers has now been the team’s leading point-getter twice in the last four matches.</p>
<p>Rio Claro Farmers plays Brotas Alligators (3-4, 802.14) in Week 8, while Goncalves Miners gets Limeira Guara Wolf (4-3, 787.78).</p>
</div>
<div id="london-knights-blasts-indaiatuba-blues-to-capture-3rd-place" class="section level3">
<h3>London Knights Blasts Indaiatuba Blues to Capture 3rd Place</h3>
<p>London Knights took advantage of 31.70 points from James Robinson (119 Rsh Yds, 1 2PT, 1 Rsh TD, 1 Rec TD) and 27.76 from Carson Wentz (359 Pas Yds, 2 Pas TD/1 Int, 1 Rsh TD), destroying Indaiatuba Blues 138.06 to 87.20. London Knights took a 20.16-point lead on Thursday and never looked back. This beatdown was revenge for a loss to Indaiatuba Blues in their last meeting a season ago. With Tyler Higbee delivering zero points for London Knights, the margin could have been larger. London Knights (4-3, 848.40 points) climbs into third place and Indaiatuba Blues (4-3, 826.68 points) drops to sixth place.</p>
<p>Clyde Edwards-Helaire probably deserved more touches for London Knights, as he put up a whopping 63 total yards on just nine touches.</p>
<p>Since Robinson was the top point-getter for London Knights, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 23.10 points, Allen Robinson paced the squad in Week 4, while Calvin Ridley (21.60 points) was tops in Week 5 and Carson Wentz (29.42 points) last week.</p>
<p>London Knights matches up against top-ranked Campinas Giants (5-2, 842.14) next week. Indaiatuba Blues will square off against Paulinia Robots (3-4, 838.10).</p>
