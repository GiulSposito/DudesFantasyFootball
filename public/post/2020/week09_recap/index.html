<p>Limeira Guara Wolf is on a five-game winning streak.</p>
<p>Rio Claro Farmers is on a three-game winning streak.</p>

<h3>Behind a Sizzling Showing from Dalvin Cook, Paulinia Robots Beats Goncalves Miners</h3>
<p>With the production from Dalvin Cook playing an integral role, Paulinia Robots defeated Goncalves Miners 144.54 to 117.60. Cook heated up for 39.20 points in a 26.94-point win for Paulinia Robots. He rushed for 206 yards as part of his huge game (206 Rsh Yds, 46 Rec Yds, 2 TD). He also recorded the highest point total in the league this week.

<p>James Conner had plenty of chances for Paulinia Robots, but he logged just 22 total yards on 11 touches. One spot where Goncalves Miners made a blunder is wide receiver. Tyreek Hill could have started in place of Adam Thielen, and that point difference would have changed the outcome.</p>
<p>Cook has now led Paulinia Robots in scoring in consecutive weeks.</p>
<p>In Week 10, Paulinia Robots plays Campinas Giants (6-3, 1,054.12), while Goncalves Miners gets Brotas Alligators (3-6, 974.64).</p>

<h3>Indaiatuba Blues Tops Campinas Giants, Expels Them from 1st Place</h3>
