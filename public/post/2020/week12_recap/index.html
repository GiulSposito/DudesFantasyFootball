<h3>Paulinia Robots Gets Win Against Limeira Dead Rabbits, Moves Up to 4th Place</h3>
<p>Paulinia Robots took advantage of the third-highest score by a player this week from Antonio Gibson with 36.60 points (115 Rsh Yds, 3 TD) to beat Limeira Dead Rabbits 135.34 to 118.88. Paulinia Robots took a 39.38-point lead on Thursday and remained in front for the rest of the matchup. These two teams are tied for fourth place with 7-5 records, but Paulinia Robots has a clear lead in points, 1,530.92 to 1,342.68. Even though both teams hit their projections, Paulinia Robots put up 4.5% more than their projected 129.54 points to secure the win. Dallas Goedert (acquired via free agency in Week 9) and DeVante Parker (acquired via free agency in Week 9) made a big impact, posting 20.50 and 19.90 points, respectively. The margin could have been larger as Paulinia Robots had a starter score zero points (the Cleveland Browns DEF).</p>
<p>While Justin Herbert led Paulinia Robots weeks (with 27.74 points), Gibson has now been the team’s top scorer in two of the past three matches.</p>
<p>In Week 13, Paulinia Robots will match up against Barao Butchers (4-8, 1,352.84). Limeira Dead Rabbits takes on Sorocaba Wild Mules (9-3, 1,348.94), who sits in first place.</p>

<h3>Sorocaba Wild Mules Brings Down Campinas Giants for 3rd in a Row</h3>
<p>One week after a blowout victory, Sorocaba Wild Mules (9-3, 1,348.94 points) got a tough win against Campinas Giants (7-5, 1,365.72 points) 123.42 to 88.22. Sorocaba Wild Mules was first to put points on the board and went into Sunday with a 13.90 to 0.00 lead. That advantage slipped away after the early Sunday games and they trailed by 5.42. However, following the late Sunday games, Sorocaba Wild Mules regained the lead for good.</p>
<p>Ronald Jones really deserved more touches for Sorocaba Wild Mules, as he put up a whopping 103 total yards on just 10 touches.</p>
<p>While Keenan Allen led Sorocaba Wild Mules in Week 11 with 34.50 points, Jefferson paved the way this week with 26.00.</p>
<p>In Week 13, Sorocaba Wild Mules plays Limeira Dead Rabbits (7-5, 1,342.68), while Campinas Giants matches up with Amparo Bikers (5-7, 1,381.44).</p>

<h3>Goncalves Miners Gets Win Against Indaiatuba Riders for 3rd Straight Win</h3>
<p>This week’s two highest-scoring teams met in an epic battle as Goncalves Miners defeated Indaiatuba Riders 148.70 to 139.92. This is the most a team has scored this season without getting a victory. The loss drops Indaiatuba Riders to 2-10 (14th place) and extends their losing streak to five. Goncalves Miners (6-6) has the second-highest points per game average at 122.72. However, the score from Indaiatuba Riders was unexpected given that they were only expected to score 105.42 points. Unfortunately, Goncalves Miners scored 124.9% of their projected 119.04. Even with a 107.81 points per game average, which ranks 13th in the league, Indaiatuba Riders has a 2-10 record. Tyreek Hill (269 Rec Yds, 3 TD) accumulated the highest score of the season (57.90) and Robby Anderson scored 19.40 points to lead Goncalves Miners. Derrick Henry (178 Rsh Yds, 3 TD) got the second-highest score this week (38.50) and Deshaun Watson scored 33.12 points for Indaiatuba Riders. Indaiatuba Riders got nothing from Jared Cook, which may have made the difference in the outcome. Although emerging victorious this time, Goncalves Miners has been on the losing end of a similar high-scoring matchup once before, suffering a tough loss against Amparo Bikers in Week 6, 130.60 to 129.94.</p>
<p>There was one starter on Indaiatuba Riders that missed out on some chances. Even though Mike Evans saw a total of nine targets, he reeled in just three catches.</p>
<p>Since Hill was the top point-getter for Goncalves Miners, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 20.80 points, Stefon Diggs paced the squad in Week 9, while D’Andre Swift (25.90 points) was tops in Week 10 and Adam Thielen (32.30 points) last week.</p>
<p>Goncalves Miners squares off against Sorocaba Steelers (6-6, 1,338.18) in Week 13, while Indaiatuba Riders matches up with Brotas Alligators (4-8, 1,252.70).</p>

<h3>Indaiatuba Blues Beats Amparo Bikers, Drops Them into 10th Place</h3>
<p>Indaiatuba Blues benefited from 23.20 points from Amari Cooper (112 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and 19.14 from Ryan Tannehill (221 Pas Yds, 1 Pas TD, 1 Rsh TD) to beat Amparo Bikers 120.84 to 102.88. Indaiatuba Blues took a 50.40-point lead on Thursday and maintained an advantage throughout the matchup. This win was a bit of revenge for Indaiatuba Blues following a tough postseason loss last year to Amparo Bikers. Amparo Bikers (5-7, 1,381.44 points) drops to 10th place and Indaiatuba Blues (6-6, 1,295.30 points) remains in seventh place.</p>
<p>While Ryan Tannehill led Indaiatuba Blues with 21.86 points last week, Cooper paced the squad this week with 23.20. Also, with eight targets this week for Cooper, it means that his targets have now increased in three consecutive games.</p>
<p>Indaiatuba Blues squares off against Rio Claro Farmers (8-4, 1,354.26) next week, while Amparo Bikers faces Campinas Giants (7-5, 1,365.72).</p>

<h3>Sorocaba Steelers Picks Up Win Against Limeira Guara Wolf</h3>
<p>Sorocaba Steelers beat Limeira Guara Wolf, who labored to score points this week, 124.24 to 87.98. Sorocaba Steelers took a 45.94-point lead on Thursday and never looked back. Limeira Guara Wolf just doesn’t have what it takes to beat Sorocaba Steelers, who extended their career unbeaten streak to three games in the series. Sorocaba Steelers (6-6, 1,338.18 points) remains in ninth place. Limeira Guara Wolf, despite the loss, clinches a playoff spot this week (second place, 8-4, 1,345.26 points).</p>
<p>Henderson had plenty of opportunities for Limeira Guara Wolf, but could only manage 19 total yards on 10 touches.</p>
<p>Since Landry was the high scorer for Sorocaba Steelers, it means that a different player has now led the team in each of the past six weeks. With 18.80 points, Tee Higgins paced the squad in Week 7, while Julio Jones (20.70 points) was team-leader in Week 8 and Jerry Jeudy (25.50 points) led the way in Week 9. Josh Jacobs (29.60 points) was tops in Week 10 and the Steelers Defense (17.00 points) led last week.</p>
<p>Sorocaba Steelers will have to step up their game in Week 13 when they go up against Goncalves Miners (6-6, 1,472.64), who averages a solid 122.72 points per game. Limeira Guara Wolf squares off against London Knights (5-7, 1,315.46).</p>

<h3>London Knights Beats Rio Claro Farmers</h3>
<p>Allen Robinson scored two touchdowns (27.40 points) and James Robinson added 26.90 points as London Knights got past Rio Claro Farmers 133.20 to 104.24. London Knights took a 2.00-point lead on Thursday and never looked back. This win was revenge for a loss to Rio Claro Farmers in their last meeting a season ago. London Knights (5-7, 1,315.46 points) remains in 11th place and Rio Claro Farmers (third place, 8-4, 1,354.26 points) earns a playoff berth despite the loss.</p>
<p>Clyde Edwards-Helaire had plenty of chances for London Knights, but he logged just 39 total yards on 12 touches.</p>
<p>Since Robinson was the top point-getter for London Knights, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 15.90 points, James Robinson paced the squad in Week 9, while Malcolm Brown (19.10 points) was tops in Week 10 and Clyde Edwards-Helaire (20.70 points) last week.</p>

<h3>Brotas Alligators Grinds Out Victory over Barao Butchers, Claims 12th Place</h3>
<p>Brotas Alligators picked up 23.90 points from Austin Ekeler (44 Rsh Yds, 85 Rec Yds) and 19.80 from A.J. Brown (98 Rec Yds, 1 TD) to edge Barao Butchers 117.00 to 112.50. After losing their sixth straight, Barao Butchers is on the verge of a forgettable season. Even though these teams are tied for 12th place with matching 4-8 records, Barao Butchers has a solid lead in points, 1,352.84 to 1,252.70. Barao Butchers got zero points from Jonnu Smith, which might have made the difference in the outcome.</p>
<p>Melvin Gordon had plenty of chances for Brotas Alligators, but he logged just 31 total yards on 12 touches.</p>
<p>While Kyler Murray led Brotas Alligators last week with 20.26 points, Ekeler paved the way this week with 23.90.</p>
