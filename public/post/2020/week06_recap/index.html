<div id="campinas-giants-comes-from-behind-to-squeak-by-indaiatuba-riders" class="section level3">
<h3>Campinas Giants Comes from Behind to Squeak By Indaiatuba Riders</h3>
<p>Campinas Giants got 18.80 points from Rob Gronkowski (78 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and 16.32 from Nick Foles (198 Pas Yds, 1 Pas TD/1 Int, 1 Rsh TD) to nip Indaiatuba Riders 108.62 to 106.42. Campinas Giants came into the Monday night game facing a 7.60-point deficit, but scored 17.30 for the comeback victory. It was one of the closest matchups to date, with the 2.20-point margin being the third-smallest recorded in the league this season. Derrick Henry racked up the highest score of the league this week with 40.40 points (212 Rsh Yds, 52 Rec Yds, 2 TD) for Indaiatuba Riders. Campinas Giants (4-2, 725.46 points) remains in first place and Indaiatuba Riders (1-5, 689.18 points) is still looking up at everyone from last place.</p>
<p>There was one fairly noteworthy starter on Campinas Giants who wasnâ€™t fully in tune with his QB. Even though DeAndre Hopkins saw a total of eight targets, he only reeled in two catches.</p>
<p>In addition to the fantasy W, Campinas Giants was keen enough to select winners in real football, as well. Every one of their starters played on a winning NFL team this past week. Since Gronkowski was the top point-getter for Campinas Giants, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 44.70 points, Alvin Kamara paced the squad in Week 3, while Jerick McKinnon (22.70 points) was tops in Week 4 and DeAndre Hopkins (25.10 points) last week.</p>
<p>Campinas Giants plays Sorocaba Steelers (3-3, 653.22) next week, while Indaiatuba Riders matches up against Limeira Dead Rabbits (3-3, 671.34).</p>

<div id="amparo-bikers-wins-comeback-nailbiter-over-goncalves-miners-claims-12th-place" class="section level3">
<h3>Amparo Bikers Wins Comeback Nailbiter over Goncalves Miners, Claims 12th Place</h3>
<p>In a shootout between this weekâ€™s two highest-scoring teams, Amparo Bikers came back after being down 44.84 on Monday night to narrowly beat Goncalves Miners 130.60 to 129.94. This is the third-most a team has scored this season without getting the victory. The loss drops Goncalves Miners to 3-3 (5th place) and breaks their two-game winning streak. Goncalves Miners actually finished with more total touchdowns (7 to 6), despite not getting the win. George Kittle (109 Rec Yds, 1 TD) got 23.90 points to score 58.7% more than projected (15.06) to lead Amparo Bikers. Lamar Jackson (186 Pas Yds, 108 Rsh Yds, 1 Pas TD, 1 Rsh TD) put up 28.24 points for Goncalves Miners.</p>

<h3>Indaiatuba Blues Steals Win from Sorocaba Steelers, Claims 3rd Place</h3>
<p>Indaiatuba Blues was clutch when the lights came on with 49.30 points on Monday Night Football (41% of their total score) to steal the win from Sorocaba Steelers 121.36 to 116.48. The late heroics were a bit unexpected, since they were originally projected to have 30.18 points on Monday night. Indaiatuba Blues was led by Ryan Tannehill this week (364 Pas Yds, 1 2PT, 4 TD/1 Int). Tannehill passed for four touchdowns and added 28.56 points to the final tally. Kenyan Drake also chipped in 28.40 points by getting 164 rushing yards (164 Rsh Yds, 2 TD). The outcome could have been worse as Indaiatuba Blues had a starter score zero points (Mike Gesicki). Indaiatuba Blues (4-2, 739.40 points) climbs into third place, while Sorocaba Steelers (3-3, 653.22 points) steps into seventh place.</p>
<p>Miles Sanders ultimately deserved more touches for Indaiatuba Blues, as he put up a whopping 118 total yards on just 10 touches.</p>
<p>Indaiatuba Blues lucked out that Josh Jacobs (18.30 points per game) had a bye this week, since top-scoring RB for Sorocaba Steelers (Mike Davis) only managed 11.50 points. If Jacobs had suited up and gotten his per-game average, Indaiatuba Blues would have lost by 1.92 points. Tannehill has now led Indaiatuba Blues in scoring in back-to-back weeks.</p>

Limeira Guara Wolf came into the Monday night game facing a 15.20-point deficit, but scored 48.48 for the comeback victory. Rio Claro Farmers is not on the same level as Limeira Guara Wolf, who extended their career unbeaten streak to two games in the series. Rio Claro Farmers, already one of the lowest-scoring teams in the league this season, scored just 48% of their 107.60 season average. Limeira Guara Wolf (3-3, 639.30 points) climbs into eighth place and Rio Claro Farmers (3-3, 645.62 points) stays in sixth place.</p>
<p>On Limeira Guara Wolf, the Tennessee Titans DEF wasnâ€™t just the one defense to post a negative score; they represented the lone fantasy starter throughout the entire league in the negatives.

<p>Kelce has now led Limeira Guara Wolf in scoring in back-to-back weeks.</p>
