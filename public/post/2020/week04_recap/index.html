<h2>League Highlights</h2>
<p>Indaiatuba Blues was projected to win by the widest margin this week (19.25 points). Not only did they lose to Barao Butchers, but they lost by a bigger margin (23.58 points) than they were projected to win by.</p>
<p>Barao Butchers has now beaten their weekly score projection in each matchup this season.</p>
<p>Sorocaba Steelers has now beaten their weekly score projection in each matchup this season.</p>
<p>Rio Claro Farmers has now beaten their weekly score projection in each matchup this season.</p>
<p>Indaiatuba Riders has now beaten their weekly score projection in each matchup this season.</p>
<p>Goncalves Miners earned the win this week despite not starting a top-30 scoring RB.</p>
<p>First-round draft picks only averaged 13.22 points this week. Second-rounders put up an average of 12.43 points, while players chosen in the third round averaged a superb 15.70.</p>
<p>As one might expect, teams have won 62.1% of the time this season when they throw no interceptions in a week.</p>
<p>No surprise here: teams have won 75.0% of the time this season when starting the league’s top-scoring QB of the week (3-1 overall).</p>
<p>Amparo Bikers probably wishes they had started George Kittle. The 40.10 points he scored would have represented the second-highest individual score this week.</p>
<p>Paulinia Robots is on a three-game winning streak.</p>
<p>The average projected score was 116.42 points this week.</p>
