<h3>Campinas Giants Smokes Sorocaba Wild Mules to Get into Championship</h3>
<p>Campinas Giants (9-6, 1,777.04 points) pummeled Sorocaba Wild Mules (9-5, 1,541.20 points) 142.66 to 82.94 in a matchup with three lead changes. They also put up the second-highest point total this week. Heading into Sunday, Campinas Giants was out in front 37.60 to 2.60. That advantage slipped away after the early Sunday games and they trailed by 8.04. However, following the late Sunday games, Campinas Giants regained the lead for good.</p>
<p>Kenyan Drake had plenty of chances for Campinas Giants, but he logged just 40 total yards on 12 touches.</p>
<p>For the winners, a few players have been getting hot in the playoffs, most notably DeAndre Hopkins and Hunter Henry. During the playoffs, that duo has surpassed their season scoring averages by 44% and 40%, respectively. Conversely, Campinas Giants has a player trending the opposite way. Drew Brees has fallen well beneath his year-to-date average in the postseason by 46%.</p>

<p>Despite the loss, Limeira Guara Wolf had a pair of players peaking for the postseason: Keke Coutee and Rashard Higgins. Over the past month, that combo has averaged 12.88 and 13.60 points, respectively, topping their season-long marks by 36% and 34%. Conversely, the losers had a player who was fading down the stretch. Tyler Lockett has dipped below his yearly average by 47% over the past month.</p>
<p>Next week, the league championship will be decided when Rio Claro Farmers faces No. 5-seeded Campinas Giants. These teams last met in Week 1, with Campinas Giants winning, 138.70 to 112.96.

<h3>Goncalves Miners Squashes London Knights, Moves on to Consolation Championship</h3>

Their record improves to 8-6, while London Knights falls to 6-9. Darren Waller racked up 150 yards and led the team this week, getting 30.00 points for Goncalves Miners. The Las Vegas TE was a great mid-round selection for Goncalves Miners and has played like a top-tier tight end. Adding insult to injury, London Knights had a starter score zero points (Carson Wentz).</p>
<p>Robinson had plenty of opportunities for London Knights, but could only manage 53 total yards on 19 touches.</p>
<p>With 14 targets this week for Calvin Ridley, it means that his targets have now increased in three consecutive games.</p>

Over the past four weeks, that duo has surpassed their season scoring averages by 51% and 42%, respectively. Conversely, Goncalves Miners has two players heading in the opposite direction. Adam Thielen and D’Andre Swift have both fallen significantly short of their year-to-date averages recently. Despite the loss, London Knights had several players performing their best in the playoffs, most notably the Arizona Cardinals DEF and T.Y. Hilton. During the postseason, that combo has averaged 13.00 and 18.35 points, respectively, topping their season-long marks by 104% and 69%. On the other hand, the losers had a couple of players who struggled in the playoff spotlight: Wentz and James Robinson.</p>
