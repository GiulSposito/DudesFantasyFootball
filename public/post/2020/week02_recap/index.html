<h2>League Highlights</h2>
<p>Limeira Guara Wolf won this week, even without starting a top-30 scoring RB.</p>
<p>London Knights used pass-catchers to their advantage by starting the league’s top-scoring WR (Ridley with 29.90 points) and the top-scoring TE (Higbee with 28.40) this week.</p>
<p>As one might expect, teams have won 68.8% of the time this season when they throw no interceptions in a week.</p>
<p>Limeira Dead Rabbits was favored to win by the biggest margin in the league this week (9.77 points) but ended up losing by 6.12 points.</p>
<p>First-round draft picks averaged 16.72 points this week. Second-round players averaged 15.32, which was actually less than the third-rounders (16.28).</p>
<p>The 142.32 points scored by Indaiatuba Blues represented the highest total in the league this week.</p>
<p>Projected winners went 5-2 overall this week.</p>

Barao Butchers (2-0, 273.54 points) shifts into first place and Sorocaba Steelers (1-1, 204.80 points) winds up in 12th place.</p>
<p>Each squad had a player that probably deserved to see more touches than he actually did. On the winning side, Raheem Mostert got just 10 touches but was able to log 107 total yards, while J.K. Dobbins put up 61 yards on only three touches for Sorocaba Steelers.</p>

<h3>Rio Claro Farmers Gets Victory Against Limeira Dead Rabbits</h3>
