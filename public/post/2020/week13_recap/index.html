<h2>Matchups Recap</h2>
<div id="powered-by-a-signature-performance-from-derek-carr-barao-butchers-beats-paulinia-robots" class="section level3">
<h3>Powered by a Signature Performance from Derek Carr, Barao Butchers Beats Paulinia Robots</h3>

He passed for 381 yards as part of his signature performance (381 Pas Yds, 3 Pas TD/1 Int, 1 Rsh TD). He also recorded his highest point total of the season. Paulinia Robots (7-6, 1,602.68 points) drops to sixth place, while Barao Butchers (5-8, 1,446.88 points) remains in 13th place.</p>
<p>Devontae Booker had plenty of chances for Barao Butchers, but he logged just 51 total yards on 17 touches.</p>
<p>Since Carr was the high scorer for Barao Butchers, it means that a different player has now led the team in each of the past six weeks. With 21.40 points, Curtis Samuel paced the squad in Week 8, while Christian McCaffrey (37.10 points) was team-leader in Week 9 and Tom Brady (31.84 points) led the way in Week 10. Chris Godwin (18.30 points) was tops in Week 11 and Will Fuller (35.10 points) led last week.</p>

<p>Limeira Dead Rabbits got the third-highest player score this week from Davante Adams with 34.10 points (121 Rec Yds, 2 TD) and erased a 10.92-point deficit on Monday night to beat Sorocaba Wild Mules 143.84 to 109.32.

<h3>Brotas Alligators Gets Late Victory over Indaiatuba Riders, Fans Flames of Failure</h3>
<p>Brotas Alligators (5-8, 1,349.92 points) beat Indaiatuba Riders (2-11, 1,381.12 points) 97.22 to 87.44. They were led by Kyler Murray with 16.42 points off of three passing touchdowns and Melvin Gordon (131 Rsh Yds), who scored 15.20.

The Broncos/Chiefs game on Sunday night came to an end with Brotas Alligators up by 1.78 and they stayed on top through the rest of the matchup.</p>
<p>Hunt had plenty of opportunities for Indaiatuba Riders, but could only manage 57 total yards on 17 touches.</p>
<p>While Austin Ekeler led Brotas Alligators weeks (with 23.90 points), Murray has now been the team’s top scorer in four of the last five matches.</p>

<h3>Amparo Bikers Steals Win from Campinas Giants, Fans Flames of Failure</h3>
<p>Amparo Bikers had an excellent primetime showing with 60.40 points on Monday Night Football (45% of their total score) to get the comeback win over Campinas Giants 135.12 to 106.38. The late heroics were a bit unexpected, since they were originally projected to tally 38.71 points on Monday night. Amparo Bikers was led by Cole Beasley, who provided 28.00 points to the final tally (130 Rec Yds, 1 TD). Amparo Bikers (6-7, 1,516.56 points) remains in 10th place, while Campinas Giants (7-6, 1,472.10 points) stays in fifth place.</p>
<p>Since Beasley was the top point-getter for Amparo Bikers, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 23.60 points, Diontae Johnson paced the squad in Week 10, while Robert Woods (30.60 points) was tops in Week 11 and Patrick Mahomes (31.28 points) last week.</p>
<p>Amparo Bikers takes on London Knights (5-8, 1,414.52) next week, while Campinas Giants matches up against Limeira Dead Rabbits (8-5, 1,486.52).</p>

<h3>Goncalves Miners Beats Up Sorocaba Steelers, Streak Climbs to Four</h3>
<p>A rally on Monday Night Football (48.60 points, 41% of their total score) wasn’t nearly enough for Sorocaba Steelers, as Goncalves Miners easily got the 185.98 to 117.94 victory. The NFL experts were spot on with their forecasts this week, as the projections had originally called for 47.83 MNF points for Sorocaba Steelers. Goncalves Miners was led by Darren Waller (200 Rec Yds, 2 TD). Waller racked up 200 yards and added 45.00 points in the beatdown. Goncalves Miners had the top overall score in the league this year, as well as the second-biggest margin of victory. Goncalves Miners (7-6, 1,658.62 points) climbs into seventh place, while Sorocaba Steelers (6-7, 1,456.12 points) stays in ninth place.</p>
<p>Gus Edwards really deserved more touches for Sorocaba Steelers, as he put up a whopping 101 total yards on just seven touches.</p>
<p>Since Waller was the leading point-getter for Goncalves Miners, it means a different player has now topped the team in each of the past five weeks. With 20.80 points, Stefon Diggs paced the squad in Week 9, while D’Andre Swift put up 25.90 points to lead the way in Week 10. Adam Thielen (32.30 points) was tops in Week 11 and Tyreek Hill (57.90 points) led in Week 12. To go along with the fantasy victory, Goncalves Miners was savvy enough to pick winners in real life, as well. Among all of their starters, Ka’imi Fairbairn is the only one that didn’t play on a winning NFL team in Week 13.</p>

<h3>Rio Claro Farmers Waxes Indaiatuba Blues, Captures Control of Career Series, 2-1</h3>
<p>Rio Claro Farmers got the fifth-highest score of the season to annihilate Indaiatuba Blues 152.40 to 94.56. This was a beatdown for the record books, with the 57.84-point margin being the eighth-highest recorded in the league this season. Rio Claro Farmers, already one of the highest-scoring teams in the league this season, beat their 115.90 per game average by 31%. Indaiatuba Blues (6-7, 1,389.86 points) drops to eighth place and Rio Claro Farmers (9-4, 1,506.66 points) remains in third place.</p>
<p>There was a player on both teams that had plenty of chances but left some points out on the field. On the Indaiatuba Blues, Miles Sanders got 10 touches but only tallied 31 total yards, while Giovani Bernard was even less effective, managing just 30 yards on 14 touches for Rio Claro Farmers.</p>
<p>While Aaron Rodgers led Rio Claro Farmers in Week 12 with 25.64 points, Davis paved the way this week with 35.20. Also, with nine targets this week for Amari Cooper, it means that his targets have now increased in four consecutive games.</p>
<p>As the regular season comes to a close, Rio Claro Farmers can now set their sights on a playoff run.</p>

<h3>Limeira Guara Wolf Rallies Against London Knights</h3>
<p>Limeira Guara Wolf was clutch when the lights came on with 43.60 points on Sunday Night Football and 30.10 on Monday (a combined 58% of their total score) to steal the win from London Knights 126.40 to 99.06. The late heroics were a bit unexpected, since they were projected to score just 26.09 points on Sunday night and only 20.95 on Monday. Limeira Guara Wolf was led by Josh Allen (375 Pas Yds, 4 TD). Allen passed for four touchdowns and contributed all 30.10 of the team’s MNF points to the final tally. Adding insult to injury, London Knights had a starter score zero points (Clyde Edwards-Helaire). Limeira Guara Wolf (9-4, 1,471.66 points) remains in second place, while London Knights (5-8, 1,414.52 points) stays in 11th place.</p>
<p>There was one starter on Limeira Guara Wolf that let some chances slip away. Despite being targeted seven times, D.J. Chark could only manage two catches.</p>
<p>While Travis Kelce led Limeira Guara Wolf in Weeks 11 and 12, Allen has now been the team’s leading point-getter in three of the last five matches.</p>
<p>As the regular season comes to a close, Limeira Guara Wolf can now set their sights on a playoff run.</p>
