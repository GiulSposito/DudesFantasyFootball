<h2>League Highlights</h2>
<p>Limeira Dead Rabbits has now beaten their weekly score projection in each matchup this season.</p>
<p>Goncalves Miners has now beaten their weekly score projection in each matchup this season.</p>
<p>Brotas Alligators has now beaten their weekly score projection in each matchup this season.</p>
<p>Goncalves Miners won this week, even without starting a top-15 scoring QB.</p>
<p>Rio Claro Farmers has now beaten their weekly score projection in each matchup this season.</p>
<p>Sorocaba Steelers has now beaten their projected score three weeks in a row.</p>
<p>No surprise here: teams have won 80.0% of the time this season when starting the leagueâ€™s top-scoring QB of the week (4-1 overall).</p>
<p>Brotas Alligators probably wishes they had started Brandin Cooks. The 30.10 points he scored would have represented the third-highest individual score this week.</p>
<p>Teams have won only 33.3% of the time this season (2-4) when they fail to throw a Pass TD.</p>
<p>Free Agents Chase Claypool, Travis Fulgham and Mike Williams combined to score more points than all of Barao Butchersâ€™s starters this week.</p>
<p>London Knights was favored to win by the biggest margin in the league this week (26.31 points) but ended up losing by 13.34 points.</p>
<p>Indaiatuba Blues scored 158.30 points this week, which is now the highest mark in the league this season.</p>
<p>The average projected score for Week 5 was 112.44 points.</p>

<h2>Matchups Recap</h2>
<div id="rio-claro-farmers-snatches-one-from-paulinia-robots-to-grab-6th-place" class="section level3">
<h3>Rio Claro Farmers Snatches One from Paulinia Robots to Grab 6th Place</h3>
<p>Rio Claro Farmers was clutch when the lights came on with 51.56 points on Monday Night Football (43% of their total score) to steal the win from Paulinia Robots 120.66 to 106.26. The late heroics were especially impressive, as they were originally projected to put up just 28.90 points on Monday night. Rio Claro Farmers was led by Justin Herbert (264 Pas Yds, 4 TD). The Los Angeles Chargers QB passed for four touchdowns and provided 27.36 points to the cause. Rio Claro Farmers (3-2, 594.42 points) climbs into sixth place, while Paulinia Robots (3-2, 631.14 points) drops to seventh place.</p>
<p>There was one starter on Paulinia Robots that let some chances slip through his hands. Even though Terry McLaurin saw a total of seven targets, he reeled in just three catches. One spot where Paulinia Robots wishes they could get a re-do is wide receiver. CeeDee Lamb could have started in place of Terry McLaurin, and that point difference wouldâ€™ve altered the outcome.</p>
<p>With 19 touches this week for David Johnson, it means that his touches have now increased in three consecutive games.</p>
<p>Next week, Rio Claro Farmers plays Limeira Guara Wolf (2-3, 554.82), while Paulinia Robots goes up against London Knights (2-3, 587.82).</p>

<h3>Limeira Guara Wolf Gets Late Win over Amparo Bikers to Move into 11th Place</h3>
