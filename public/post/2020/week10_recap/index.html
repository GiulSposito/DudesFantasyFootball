<div id="sorocaba-wild-mules-beats-london-knights-captures-control-of-career-series-3-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Sorocaba Wild Mules Beats London Knights, Captures Control of Career Series, 3-1</h3>

London Knights has now dropped three straight. Malcolm Brown led London Knights with 19.10 points (33 Rsh Yds, 2 TD) while James Robinson brought in 13.20 (109 Rsh Yds). London Knights (4-6, 1,086.76 points) drops to 11th place and Sorocaba Wild Mules (7-3, 1,096.24 points) remains in first place.</p>
<p>Both teams had a important player that missed out on some opportunities. Interestingly enough, Michael Thomas (on Sorocaba Wild Mules) and Anthony Miller (London Knights) were able to match each other’s futility. They each saw seven targets, yet could only reel in two catches apiece.</p>
<p>While Keenan Allen led Sorocaba Wild Mules with 25.30 points in Week 9, Jones paced the squad this week with 24.80.</p>
<p>Sorocaba Wild Mules plays Indaiatuba Blues (5-5, 1,089.90) next week, while London Knights faces Amparo Bikers (4-6, 1,134.94).</p>

<h3>Rio Claro Farmers Rallies to Beat Indaiatuba Riders, Notches 4th in a Row</h3>
<p>Rio Claro Farmers picked up 25.40 points from Aaron Rodgers (325 Pas Yds, 2 Pas TD/1 Int, 1 Rsh TD) to defeat Indaiatuba Riders 97.20 to 84.72. Rio Claro Farmers came into the Sunday night game facing a 0.62-point deficit, but scored 13.10 for the comeback victory. This matchup included three lead changes, with the largest lead being the final margin. This shocker was revenge for a loss to Indaiatuba Riders in their last meeting a season ago. If Indaiatuba Riders didn’t have both Jared Cook and the Football Team Defense put up zeroes, it could have gone the other way. Rio Claro Farmers (7-3, 1,109.18 points) remains in fourth place and Indaiatuba Riders (2-8, 1,047.60 points) stays locked in last place.</p>
<p>Rodgers has now led Rio Claro Farmers in scoring in back-to-back weeks, and for three of the last four.</p>
<p>Rio Claro Farmers takes on Sorocaba Steelers (5-5, 1,115.66) next week, while Indaiatuba Riders faces Limeira Guara Wolf (7-3, 1,131.60).</p>

<div id="powered-by-a-signature-performance-from-josh-jacobs-sorocaba-steelers-beats-amparo-bikers" class="section level3">
<h3>Powered by a Signature Performance from Josh Jacobs, Sorocaba Steelers Beats Amparo Bikers</h3>
<p>With the contribution from Josh Jacobs playing an integral role, Sorocaba Steelers beat Amparo Bikers 126.92 to 101.46. In the 25.46-point win for Sorocaba Steelers, the Las Vegas RB heated up for 29.60 points. He scored two touchdowns as part of his big outing (112 Rsh Yds, 2 TD). Sorocaba Steelers (5-5, 1,115.66 points) climbs into eighth place, while Amparo Bikers (4-6, 1,134.94 points) drops to ninth place.</p>
<p>Since Jacobs was the top point-getter for Sorocaba Steelers, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 18.80 points, Tee Higgins paced the squad in Week 7, while Julio Jones (20.70 points) was tops in Week 8 and Jerry Jeudy (25.50 points) last week.</p>

Barao Butchers (4-6, 1,144.50 points) drops to 12th place and Limeira Guara Wolf (7-3, 1,131.60 points) remains in second place.</p>
<p>Rex Burkhead probably deserved more touches for Barao Butchers, as he put up a whopping 66 total yards on just 10 touches.</p>
<p>Allen has now led Limeira Guara Wolf in scoring in consecutive weeks.</p>
<p>In Week 11, Limeira Guara Wolf goes up against the last-place team in the league, Indaiatuba Riders (2-8, 1,047.60). Barao Butchers will square off against Goncalves Miners (4-6, 1,194.00), who is averaging a solid 119.40 points per game.</p>
